To exemplify our approach you can find a form on our website where you can write three words, and a number, that are relevant and memorable to you. Then, our algorithm adds some symbols and includes some capital letters to generate really safe and easy to remember passwords (the logic of the password is also explained to help you memorise it in the easiest way).
